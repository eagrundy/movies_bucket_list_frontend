          <p>After the pandemic started, I have thought of how many people leave this world without having done the things they wanted. 
          <br/>We are always busy, so it is easy to just say "I am gonna do this later! I am gonna do this tomorrow, I don't have time now!"<br/> 
          But then life goes on and when we realize we have not done most of the things we wanted to do, it is too late.<br/>
          I am one of the rare people that have never seen some of the most famous movies like "Avatar", "The Matrix" or "The Lord of the Rings".<br/>
          I always say "I am gonna watch them one day!". But the day never comes.<br/>
          So I have decided to create an application where I am gonna be able to create a list of the movies I've never seen.</p>
