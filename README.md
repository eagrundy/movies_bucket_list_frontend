**Description:**
Since I am the most procrastinator in watching new and old movies on tv, and since I never watch a movie once I have missed it in the movie theater, I have decided to create an app where I am able to make a list of the movies I have never seen (most of them are classics and very famous) but that I would like to see it someday. The user can:
-  Add a new movie to the list;
- Click on the movie's title to see a description, a date as a deadline to watch the movie, a click button to search on google where to watch it, a button to search on google for the movie's trailer;
- Delete a movie;
- Search a movie.
